        <p className="hobby-page-text">Shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, I rediscovered a love of reading.</p>
        <p className="hobby-page-text">I prefer non-fiction, usually gravitating to books that cover psychology, philosphy, sociology and politics.</p>
        <p className="hobby-page-text">My favourite book is War and Peace. As well as being a well-written story, I loved that Tolstoy takes sizeable detours from the narrative to speak directly to the reader, usually to correct the inaccuracies of historians - in the case of one battle, based on his first-hand experience of what happened.</p>
