        <p className="hobby-page-text">I frequently visit the cinema to see new releases.</p>
        <p className="hobby-page-text">At home, I like to chronologically make my way through a director's filmography - both to see how their craft developed over time, as well as checking out some films that I would otherwise not bother watching.</p>
        <p className="hobby-page-text">The director I'm currently on is Akira Kurosawa (most known for Seven Samurai). His film Ikiru is my favourite thus far.</p>
